  %h1 About HappyCasts
  %p 
    HappyCasts is produced by Peter Wang ( 
    = link_to "happypeter", "http://happypeter.org" 
    and 
    = link_to "happypeter", "https://github.com/happypeter"
    on GitHub). A new episode will be released
    each Monday featuring tips and tricks with Linux. The screencasts are short
    and focus on one technique so you can quickly move on to applying it to your
    own project. The topics target the intermediate Linux developer, but
    beginners and experts will get something out of it as well.
