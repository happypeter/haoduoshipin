我是研一的时候接触到了 Linux 和开源文化，整个改变了我的职业观。所以今天翻译了 wikipedia 上的
这个[动画](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) ，和你一起分享开源的魅力。

Hi, I am Jonas. Do you know what open source is? Let me explain it for you.

Basically it means the recipe for any given work is shared and free for anybody to use.
Let me take you back where all started. In the 1980's, a guy named Richard Stallman had a
problem with the software in his printer, he could fix the printer himself but unfortunately
he was not allowed to get inside the black box by the manufacture.

This frustration was the beginning of the free and open source movement. The essential benefits
of open source are: a) Access to the source or recipe of any given work. b) Free remix and redistribution of any given work. c) End to predatory vendor lock-in D) Higher degree of cooperation

Open Source is originally a software related term. But let's take a non-technical example
of where the open source mindset is actaully used today.

Here is Dave, he is a really passionate skate boarder. He loves the commnuity because everyone
share the tricks and tips openly. This means everybody has access to the source of becoming
a better skate boarder. Dave has the opportunity of remixing an exsiting trick and making it
even better. He becomes more skilled faster.

If Dave's skate board breaks, he does not necessarily go back to the vendor to get it fixed,
he can also fix it himself with the help of one of his friends in his commnuity. This is because
the design of the skate board is open source. In the skate board commnuity, you share new ideas
and remix each other's tricks. You cooperate and reach much higher standard than any skate boarder
can reach alone.

Now let's take another example, here is Susan and Michael, they just bought a new property and now
need a new house. John  is a open source architect and offers 3 design that Susan and Michael can base
their dream house on. They chose option A, because it best fits their needs. But Susan wants a conserventory
as well. So Michael draws one and add that as a extension to the chosen house design option A.

Susan and Michael chose company A to help building the house. It should be easy for company A to build it
because the architectural drawings and guidelines are already produced by Jone the open source architect.
But during the process Susan and Michael find out company A's employees are very slow and not very polite.
They therefore get company B to finish the work, it's easy for company B to take over the project because
everything is openly documented.

Fortunately company B does a amazing job of completing the construction project. In the mean time Coco and June
have shared a new solar cell design as a extension to option A as well. Susan and Michael also decide to add that
to their home. Susan and Michael are now happy owner of a beautiful and customized new home. But John is also
happy because he can now add two extensions to his professional pro folio without having done anything himself.

So now I have given you some of the many benefits of open source, but before I leave you, I have to put a end to
some of the myths that do exist.

First, you have no control of your work. That's not true. As the initiator, John the open source architect
verifys extensions and chooses what can be added to his specific project. And therefore also decides where
the project is heading.

Second, open equals unsafe. Not true. In a open source, many people are involved and cooperate to make it
even safer product and to keep unauthorized people out.

Third, everthing is free. No. The source itself is free, and publicly available but the house must, for example
still be built, customized, maintained, provided with water power and heat.

Hopefully now you can better understand the positive term open source and the principles within. Plz start
opening up and use the extreme beneficial principles the way they deserve. As mentioned, my name is Jonas,
and I am representing  bitblueprint.com. We have in collaboration with movingmonday.com made this video to
help scale the positive principles within The Open Source Paradigm.

We have of course made this video for everyone to use modify and share. So feel free to do that. Thanks for watching.
